Put all files under me to $ANDROID_ROOT/device/ingenic/warrior/

****PART ONE: Building the System****
1. Initialize the environment with the envsetup.sh script.
    $ source build/envsetup.sh
or
    $ . build/envsetup.sh

2. Choose target.
    $ lunch full_warrior-userdebug

3. Build everything.
    $ make -j24

****PART TWO: Flashing the device****
Because fastboot is related to bootloader, so x-boot-nand.bin must be updated first.

----updating x-boot----
1. Connect the device to PC by USB cable and plug charger into the device;
2. Put device into USB-BOOT mode by pressing both Vol+ and reset at the same time and keeping Vol+ pressed for unless 2 seconds after reset is triggered;
3. Check if the device enters USB boot mode by 'lsusb', 'xxxx:4780' is the target;
4. $ cd ingenic-xboot-updater
5. $ sudo ./ingenic-xboot-updater --boot=x-boot-nand.bin;

----Flashing with FASTBOOT----
1. Run:
   # cd 'Android-root'
   # . build/envsetup.sh
   # lunch full_warrior-userdebug
   # fastboot flashall
NOTE: Because of the system is resized to 640MB, flashall will take about 10 Minutes.

2. Press 'esc' and do a reset;
NOTICE: Keeping 'esc' pressed until seeing the white USB logo.
